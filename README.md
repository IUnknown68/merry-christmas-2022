Advent Of Code 2022.

### Error handling
In most cases I omitted error handling, I considered it out of scope. Assumption is, that this test should show algorigthms, which are easier to read without clutter. But note: I'm aware that in real life code there would be considerably more.

### Style
I'm usually trying to be rather explicit in code and for example spell out intermediate variables rather than deeply nest function calls.

### Parts
A puzzle consiting of two parts, even when reusing code, is always split into two files to show the refactoring necessary to get from part 1 to part 2.
